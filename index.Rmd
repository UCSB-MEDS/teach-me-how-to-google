### Welcome to data science, where questions are aplenty!

.pull-left[

`r fontawesome::fa("angle-right", fill = "#05859B", a11y = "sem")` You will become increasingly more comfortable with **not immediately knowing** the answers to all your coding problems. It's all part of the job.

<br>

`r fontawesome::fa("angle-right", fill = "#05859B", a11y = "sem")` If it's not already, **Google** will become one of your best friends.

<br>

`r fontawesome::fa("angle-right", fill = "#05859B", a11y = "sem")` Googling is hard, and it is a skill that requries **practice.** But you **can** and **will** get better at it over time.

```{r, out.width = '120%', echo = FALSE, fig.alt = "A gif of Seth Meyers sitting at the desk of his show, Late Night, and saying 'I have a lot of questions.'"}

 ### It doesn't mean you won't still feel like this at times:
 
.center2[
```{r, out.width = '100%', out.height = '100%', echo = FALSE, fig.alt = "A gif of Ron Swanson, from the comedy TV series, Parks and Recreation, getting angry at his computer then taking it outside to toss in a dumpster."}

```
.center[
<span style = 'font-size: 85%;'>-Me still, about half the times I open RStudio</span>
]

### But the goal is to be a bit more at peace with that feeling...and have the confidence that you can find your way

```{r, out.width = '100%', echo = FALSE, fig.alt = "A cartoon drawing of an x- and y-axis plot, where the x-axis represents 'time' and the y-axis represents 'how much I know about R'. A round cartoon creature is moving through time (i.e. to the right across the x-axis). At time point one, when this creature is first beginning to learn R, it knows very little and it's facial expression suggests that it feels very intimidated. Over time, it experiences some highs and some lows. At time point eight (which is the furthest point to the right along the x-axis) this creature again feels like it knows very little about R, but instead of seeming intimidated as it did at time point one, it appears to be excited, suggesting a new sense of confidence."}

This is often referred to as **rubber duck debugging**, and it goes something like this:

> <span style = 'font-size: 55%;'>*1. Beg, borrow, steal, buy, fabricate or otherwise obtain a rubber duck (bathtub variety).*</span> 

> <span style = 'font-size: 55%;'>*2. Place rubber duck on desk and inform it you are just going to go over some code with it, if that’s all right.*</span>

> <span style = 'font-size: 55%;'>*3. Explain to the duck what your code is supposed to do, and then go into detail and explain your code **line by line**.*</span>

James Frew posted in the eds-223 channel on Monday, October 4, 2021: 

- Reminder: anytime you get an unusually cryptic error message, it doesn't hurt to just cut-n-paste a reasonably-specific chunk of the message into Google.

- For example, one of you contacted me about an error message whose last line was: `function 'Rcpp_precious_remove' not provided by package 'Rcpp'`

- That looked reasonably-specific (i.e., likely to retrieve something useful, and unlikely to retrieve cat memes), so I Googled it: https://www.google.com/search?q=function+%27Rcpp_precious_remove%27+not+provided+by+package+%27Rcpp%27

- First hit was: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/68416435/rcpp-package-doesnt-include-rcpp-precious-remove which solved the problem.

## A curated **vocabulary list** of R terminology may help

  - I would love to expand on this, with a focus on data wrangling and visualization. Ping me with ideas!

Once you find a search result, it’s ok in the beginning to copy and paste without fully understanding what the code does. Over time, as you get better at coding, the code that other people post will make more sense.

<span style = 'font-size: 90%;'>[Pseudocode](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pseudocode) is a step-by-step written "outline" of your code that you can then transcribe into a programming language (in our case, likely R). It is written in plain language (e.g. English), but uses the structural conventions of a programming language.</span>

While pseudocode is often used for planning out more complex algorithms, practicing with simpler examples may help you to avoid making mistakes -- pseudocode forces you acknowledge what each line of your script is meant to do, before you even write any code.

Code comments are great, but variable and function names that explain what they are/do are even better.

## `r fontawesome::fa("laptop-code", fill = "#93C6C2", a11y = "sem")` Practice problems

Copy and paste the following coding challenges into an R script or Rmd file. Problems may have more than one error or missing code (be mindful, you might not even get an error message) to identify and fix.  

More than one solution may exist for each problem -- I'd love to hear about the different ways people approach these, so please be prepared to share the steps (Googling, looking at documentation, reading error messages, etc.) you took with the class!  

*Remember:* running code line-by-line is one of the best ways to isolate errors.

## Problem 1

**Goal:** You have two data sets, `a` and `b`. Each contain the same attributes (i.e. columns) -- `month`, `season`, and `daylight_savings`. Identify which records (i.e. rows of data) in data table `a` are not contained in data table `b`.

```{r, echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE}
a <- data.frame(month = c("October", "November", "December", "January", "February"),
                season = c("Fall", "Fall", "Winter", "Winter", "Winter"),
                daylight_savings = c("yes", "partly", "no", "no", "no"))

b <- data.frame(month = c("October", "December", "February"),
                season = c("Fall", "Winter", "Winter"),
                daylight_savings = c("yes", "no", "no"))
```
